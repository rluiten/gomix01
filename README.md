Updated version derived from https://gomix.com/#!/project/sqlite3-db
and copied onboarding bot stuff over it to see if the .data folder then works.

Seems recreating project fixed the writing to .data folder dangit.


# Slack Onboarding Bot
This project demonstrates how to build a Slack bot using Slack's Events API.

The example project is adapted from Slack's [example Onboarding app](https://github.com/slackhq/onboarding-example), but with support for OAuth.
